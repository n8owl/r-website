<p>During 2020 several new R-packages providing data relating to the global pandemic COVID-19 were released. One of these is <a href="https://covid19.apple.com/mobility"><strong>Appleâ€™s mobility trend data</strong></a>, which the tech-giant released to the public this spring. (Shortly after, <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/"><strong>Google</strong></a> released their own mobility data which I will dive into in an upcoming post).</p>
<p>The mobility data from both Apple and Google is available in the R <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/covid19mobility/index.html"><strong>covid19mobility</strong></a> package.</p>
