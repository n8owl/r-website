<h3>Data Science with R</h3>
<p><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><strong>R for Data Science</strong></a> This book starts with data visualisation and transformation of data that’s already been imported and tidied which was perfect for me because my previous experience in R mostly involved importing and tidying data in order to create some sort of ABT (Analytical Base Table) which I would export to a csv-file for further manipulation in other programs, or running a quite simple model on ready data. I recommend you to start with chapters 1-8, followed by chapter 27 covering R Markdown and chapter 18 covering piping before you start with the rest.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030396428"><strong>Text Analysis with R - For Students of Literature - Second Edition (2020)</strong></a> by author <a href="https://www.matthewjockers.net/"><strong>Matthew Jockers</strong></a> is quite good as a <strong>complement</strong> to O’Reilly’s book mentioned above.</p>
