### Data Science with R
[**R for Data Science**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) This book starts with data visualisation and transformation of data thatâ€™s already been imported and tidied which was perfect for me because my previous experience in R mostly involved importing and tidying data in order to create some sort of ABT (Analytical Base Table) which I would export to a csv-file for further manipulation in other programs, or running a quite simple model on ready data. I recommend you to start with chapters 1-8, followed by chapter 27 covering R Markdown and chapter 18 covering piping before you start with the rest.



### Text mining and natural language processing with R

[**Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach**](https://www.tidytextmining.com) 

[**Text Analysis with R - For Students of Literature - Second Edition (2020)**](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030396428) by author [**Matthew Jockers**](https://www.matthewjockers.net/) is quite good as a **complement** to O'Reilly's book mentioned above.
